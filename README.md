# Rackyview
An iOS mobile app.

The source code is not here... yet. This is just a place for people to open issues if the app has bugs. I don't guarantee the speed that I can fix 'em since this is my first mobile app ever, but I will make an effort as time permits.

Do note however that while the original people behind the concept/mockups of this mobile app are no longer around, they did choose a minimalist approach that I strongly agreed with at the time. I intend to hold to that idea. As such, this app will never have anything close to all the features of the official Rackspace app nor the Rackspace website. This app's focus is pretty much exclusively alarms & tickets at a very high level; intended to be very elementary and easy to understand. If you need more power, I suggest the official Rackspace app and the Rackspace website controlPanel.
